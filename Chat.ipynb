Missions are meticulously planned years in advance, taking into account gravitational assists (using the gravity of planets to slingshot the probe), fuel efficiency, and the target's position at the time of arrival.  Sophisticated software and simulations are used to calculate optimal trajectories.\n",
            "* **Course Corrections:**  Small course corrections are often needed mid-flight to account for minor deviations.  These are performed using thrusters.\n",
            "* **Communication:**  Maintaining communication with a probe billions of kilometers away is a major challenge.  Deep Space Network antennas are used to send commands and receive data, often with significant time delays.\n",
            "* **Power:**  Probes rely on solar panels (closer to the sun) or Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, further away) for power.  Power management is critical for mission success.\n",
            "* **Navigation Systems:**  Onboard navigation systems use star trackers (to determine orientation) and inertial measurement units (to track changes in velocity) to maintain course.\n",

            "* **Life Support:**  Sustaining human life during years-long journeys requires advanced life support systems, including oxygen generation, waste recycling, radiation shielding, and food production.\n",
            "* **Crew Health:**  The psychological and physical effects of prolonged space travel need to be carefully considered and mitigated.\n",
            "* **Emergency Procedures:**  Robust emergency protocols must be in place to handle unforeseen events.\n",
            "* **Propulsion:**  Current chemical rockets are too slow for interstellar travel.  Advanced propulsion systems, such as nuclear fusion or ion drives, are needed for faster and more efficient travel.\n",
            "* **Navigation and Guidance:**  More sophisticated navigation systems, possibly including autonomous guidance and AI, will be crucial for long-duration missions.\n",
